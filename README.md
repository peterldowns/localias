# localias

`localias` is a CLI utility for developers to control local test domains. You can use it to alias arbitrary domains to local dev servers. Built on [`caddy`](https://caddyserver.com/), you get automatic TLS configuration and good performance out of the box.

A simple example would be to make it possible to visit `https://server.test` in your browser, and have that request served by a local devserver running at `http://localhost:3000`.

```shell
$ localias
securely proxy domains to local development servers

Usage:
  localias [command]

Examples:
  # Add an alias forwarding https://secure.test to http://127.0.0.1:9000
  localias set secure.test 9000
  # Update an existing alias to forward to a different port
  localias set secure.test 9001
  # Remove an alias
  localias remove secure.test
  # Show aliases
  localias list
  # Clear all aliases
  localias clear
  # Run the server, automatically applying all necessary rules to
  # /etc/hosts and creating any necessary TLS certificates
  localias run
  # Run the server as a daemon
  localias daemon start
  # Check whether or not the daemon is running
  localias daemon status
  # Reload the config that the daemon is using
  localias daemon reload
  # Stop the daemon if it is running
  localias daemon stop

Available Commands:
  clear       clear all aliases
  daemon      interact with the daemon process
  help        Help about any command
  list        list all aliases
  remove      remove an alias
  run         run the caddy server
  set         add or edit an alias
  version     show the version of this binary

Flags:
  -c, --configfile string   path to the configuration file to edit
  -h, --help                help for localias
  -v, --version             version for localias

Use "localias [command] --help" for more information about a command.

## Errata

### Domain conflicts and HSTS

When using Localias, you **should not** create aliases with the same name as existing websites. For instance, if you're working on a website hosted in production at `https://example.com`, you really do not want to create a local alias for `example.com` to point to your development server. If you do,
your browser may do things you don't expect:

- Your development cookies will be included in requests to production, and vice-versa. If you are turning localias off/on and switching between
  development and production, these cookies will conflict with each other and generally make you and your website extremely confused.
- If your production website uses [HSTS / certificate pinning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security), you will see
  very scary errors when trying to use it as a local alias for a development server. This is because localias will be serving content with a different
  private key, but HSTS explicitly tells your browser to disallow this.

In general, it's best to avoid this problem entirely and use aliases that end in [`.test`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.test), [`.example`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.example), [`.localhost`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.localhost), or some other TLD that is not in use.

### `.local` domains on MacOS
If you add an alias to a `.local` domain on a Mac, resolving the domain for the first time [will take add ~5-10s to every
request thanks to Bonjour](https://superuser.com/questions/1596225/dns-resolution-delay-for-entries-in-etc-hosts). The workaround would be to set `127.0.0.1 domain.local` as well as `::1 domain.local` but that's tricky with the way that the `hostctl` package is currently implemented. 

### Firefox and the System Trust Store
Localias's proxy server, Caddy, automatically generates certificates for any
secure aliases you'd like to make. When Localias runs, or the daemon starts, it
will install its root signing certificate into your system store on Mac and
Windows. This means that when you browse to one of your aliases using one of the
following setups, everything works great and your browser will not show any
errors.

- MacOS + Safari
- MacOS + Edge
- MacOS + Chrome
- WSL2 + Chrome
- WSL2 + Edge

Firefox, though, [does not trust the system certificate store by default](https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/AddRootToFirefox).
This means that when you start Localias and try to browse to an alias for the first time, you will see a warning about an untrusted certificate. You can safely proceed, but it's annoying and looks bad.

But! You can fix this problem, and here's how:

#### MacOS

To make Firefox use the default trust stores that caddy edits: open Firefox,
visit `about:config`, and set

```
security.enterprise_roots.enabled = true
```

This will tell Firefox to trust the system certificate store, and should immediately fix the problem.

#### Windows

Setting `security.enterprise_roots.enabled = true` like on MacOS unfortunately does not work on Windows. The best way is to open Firefox's security settings and manually add the root certificate as a trusted authority. You can do this with the following steps:

1. Find the path to the root certificate being used by Localias. Inside your WSL terminal, run:
   ```console
   $ wslpath -w $(localias debug cert)
   \\wsl$\Ubuntu-20.04\home\pd\.local\state\localias\caddy\pki\authorities\local\root.crt
   ```
   Copy this path to the clipboard.
1. In Firefox, visit *Settings > Privacy & Security > Security > Certificates*,
   or visit *Settings* and search for "certificates".
1. Click *View Certificates*
1. Under the *Authorities* tab, click *Import...*. This will open a filepicker dialog. In the "Name" field, paste the path to the root certificate that you copied earlier. Click *Open*.
1. Check the box next to *Trust this CA to identify websites.* then click *OK*.
1. You should now see "localias" listed as a certificate authority.

Once localias has been added as a certificate authority, you should be able to visit your aliases in Firefox without any security warnings.


### Allow Caddy to bind to ports 443/80 on Linux
Localias is built by wrapping the Caddy webserver, and when you `localias run` or `localias daemon start`, that webserver will attempt to listen on ports 443/80. On Linux you may not be allowed to do this by default. You will see an error like:

```shell
$ localias run
# ... some informational output
error: loading new config: http app module: start: listening on :443: listen tcp :443: bind: permission denied
```

or you may notice that starting the daemon does not result in a running daemon
```shell
$ localias daemon start
$ localias daemon status
daemon is not running
```

To fix this, after installing or upgrading localias, you can use capabilities to
grant `localias` permission to bind on these privileged ports:

```bash
sudo setcap CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE=+eip $(which localias)
```

For more information, view the [arch man pages for `capabilities`](https://man.archlinux.org/man/capabilities.7#CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE) and [this Stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/414258).
